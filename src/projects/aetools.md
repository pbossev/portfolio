## Motivation

I started this Discord bot sometime in late 2021, aiming to streamline and make the processes of a 5,000+ player Warframe clan more efficient. It ended up integrating with the Google Sheets API, as well as scraping some data from the Warframe Wiki. It was my first introduction to SQL databases, as well as working with a larger codebase. None of the code is currently available as it has many keys and credentials that I not sure the statuses of.

## Continuation

The project currently lives on with [UnKnownnPasta](https://github.com/UnKnownnPasta/NotAETools). He has even implemented a web interface and taken it far beyond what I ever imagined when I started it in 2021.

## Technologies

It used Discord.js, Javascript, Puppeteer, Node.js, and some SQLite3 library.
