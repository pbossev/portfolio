## Motivation

I made this app in December 2022, in a few days during winter break in order to learn more about mobile development and <a href="https://flutter.dev/" class="flutter arrow-external">Flutter</a>. I initially also had the intention of making an app that I would personally use on a day to day basis, but I found a much better solution with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bendix.flux" class="flutter arrow-external">Flux</a>, and stopped working on zWeather once I felt happy with the app.

## Technologies

It used font-awesome icons, as well as APIs from <a href="https://open-meteo.com/" class="flutter arrow-external">Open Meteo</a> for both getting weather info, and geocoding. All weather data and locations were stored in a local JSON file for the user.
