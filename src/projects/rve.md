## Motivation

Digging through my vast collection of 5 minute NVIDIA shadowplay video game clips, I was tired of how inefficient the process was to find the timestamps of the important sections and then cut it out using FFMPEG. So I made a little CLI video editor that allowed me to save important clips much faster. It has since expanded and been refined, and I soon plan to add audio functionality and even more.
